# Overview
In this project we examined the coverage estimation of seagrass from underwater videos recorded by scuba divers in Danish coastal waters. There were total 14 video transects from strategically different part of a fjord ( Roskilde, Denmark). A feature extractor,  line segment detector to detect number of egdes from video frames is used to extract two features: *number of lines detected* and *length of lines detected* and are reported in the folder *Raw extracted data* along with gps coordinates and they form the meta-data used for this analysis.
